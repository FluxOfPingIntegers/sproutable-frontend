Sproutable A Place for Sprout Tables

This web app searches locations via zip code from a Rails backend that utilizes the USDA National Farmers Market Directory API (https://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html) and displays pages with pictures pulled from Imsea the image Api (https://imsea.herokuapp.com/). along with information about products provided and hours of operation.

Getting started

Step 1: Sign in or create a user account

Step 2: Edit your information, you could include a url of an image for your profile

Step 3: Search a zip code to view a list of Farmers Markets in that area

Step 4: Click on the Farmers Market to its information

Installation

First: You will need developer software, I used Visual Studio Code. Depending on your operating system you should follow these instructions: Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows macOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac Linux: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

Second: You will need to clone the repo for this software and pull it up in VS Code. In your terminal please navigate to the folder you would like the files for this software to be and type "git clone git@github.com:FluxOfPingIntegers/congo_client.git" then "cd congo_client" then "code .".

Third: You will need to clone/run the repo for the backend for this software. Instructions can be found in the README here:
https://github.com/FluxOfPingIntegers/sproutable-backend

Fourth: After starting up the associated backend Rails server, go back within this repo.  Inside VS code within the main folder type "npm install" and then one that finishes its process type "npm start" the app should then boot within your browser (chrome in my case).

Finally you are ready to proceed to the Getting Started section of this README

Contribute This is a project I am building for school (and for fun) and I am not currently looking for contributors. This may change in the future though!
