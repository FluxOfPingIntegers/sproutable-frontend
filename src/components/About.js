    <h2>What is Sproutable?</h2>
    <p>Sproutable is an online resource seeking to connect community farmers and makers with those who appreciate these locally sourced goods and/or services.</p>
    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
    <p>Simply enter your zip code or one nearby into the search bar on the top left.  A list of local farmers markets will appear, click on one to view its details and find out about its next upcoming event.</p>
    <h2>What if I wish to list my farm/products on Sproutable?</h2>
    <p>You will have to create an account and then create a "vendor" account.  Once this is done a new option will appear called "vendor page" click this and there will be an option to list your products as well as a list of farmers markets near the zipcode associated with your account.  Check the ones you plan on hosting a table at.</p>
    <h2>What if I wish to contact/buy from farmers directly?</h2>
    <p>Sproutable does not currently facilitate transactions as we wish to keep things local.  However if you are logged in you can view each vendors products and contact information as well as events they plan on going to.</p>
